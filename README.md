# OpenUI5-SAPUI5-Local-Development-Template
Template for local development, alternative to SAP WebIDE.

Last week I had to travel to another city and I couldn't connect to Internet, and well because sap dev tools for SAPUI5/OPENUI5 are mostly web I kinda got nothing to do for a couple of days. I'm creating this template to run a local web server compatible with SAPUI5/OPENUI5, in order to use local dev tools and well... be able to work offline and use my favourite dev tools.
